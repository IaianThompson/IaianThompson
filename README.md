Since 2019 I joined the internet, around the rise of TikTok, and with other various platforms taking the concept of short-form content and running with it. I excel at creating meaning behind a few words and making a big impact through nostalgia and being genuine. Working in the marketing field I have given many musicians & and small labels with their marketing while also adapting my content to adhere to internet standards.

I strive to make the best of the situation, if a post, blog, video, or any other form of advertisement doesn't go in its intended direction, we learn from it and advance and learn from it.
